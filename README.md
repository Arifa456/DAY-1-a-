**Here are the questions for above codes:**


 1. **Variable Types: Local, Instance, and Static**  
   - Differences between local, instance, and static variables.  
   - Write a program to demonstrate their usage.
 
2. **Variable Scope**  
   - How does the scope of variables differ inside methods, blocks, and classes?  
   - Write a program to illustrate variable scope.
 
3. **Final Variables**  
   - What are final variables in Java, and how do they behave when modified?  
   - Write a program to demonstrate the concept.
 
4. **Type Inference (var in Java 10+)**  
   - How does Javaâ€™s `var` feature introduced in Java 10 work?  
   - Write a program demonstrating type inference for variables.
 
5. **Static vs Non-Static Variables**  
   - Difference between static and non-static variables in Java.  
   - Write a program to demonstrate their behavior in memory.
 
6. **Primitive vs Reference Variables**  
   - Differences between primitive and reference variables in Java.  
   - Write a program to explain how they behave differently.
 
7. **Constant Variables with static final**  
   - How to use `static final` variables to define constants in Java.  
   - Write a program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle using constants.
 
8. **Shadowing Variables**  
   - What is variable shadowing in Java?  
   - Write a program to demonstrate shadowing at different levels (class, method, block).
 
9. **Default Values of Variables**  
   - What are the default values of instance and static variables in Java?  
   - Write a program to display these default values.
 
10. **Volatile Variables**  
    - Purpose of the `volatile` keyword in Java.  
    - Write a program to demonstrate its effect in a multithreading scenario.
